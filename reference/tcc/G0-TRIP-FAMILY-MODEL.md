## 1. The three families at a glance

| Family | Long name | What it physically is | Curve/setting data lives in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SST / ETU** | Solid-State Trip / Electronic Trip Unit | A separate electronic trip device installed in the breaker | `DatStyle` → `DatSensor` → `DatSection1/2/3/4*` + `DatPlugs` |
| **TMT** | Thermal-Magnetic Trip | A trip mechanism **built into the breaker frame** (incl. Motor Circuit Protector variant) | `Breaker_TMTFrameSizes` → `Breaker_TMTFrameAmps` / `Breaker_TMTFrameSettings` |
| **EMT** | Electro-Mechanical Trip | A self-contained breaker+trip family modeled on its own frames/sections | `EMT` → `EMT_Frames` / `EMT_Sections` / `EMT_Curves` |

> **Naming note:** "SST" (EasyPower's internal term, from the device-library code) and "ETU"
> (electronic trip unit, the field/NETA term) are the **same family**. The DB/engine use *SST*; the
> platform UI uses *ETU*. `[DLL EasyPower.DeviceLibrary]` `[DVL-DB]`

> **Vendor-doc confirmation `[EZPDOC]` (2026-05-31):** EasyPower's official LV-Breaker help names the three
> trip categories **Solid State Trip · Thermal Magnetic · Non-Solid State Trip** — exactly our SST/ETU ·
> TMT · EMT. Two refinements from the vendor docs: **Thermal Magnetic is offered for ICCB/MCCB classes
> only** (not LVPCB), and **Non-Solid State** is the LVPCB/EMT path. The Specifications cascade
> `Class → Mfr → Type → Style → Frame → Trip → Trip-unit Mfr/Type/Style → Sensor/Plug` is the vendor's own
> description of our dual-axis selection. `[EZPDOC LV_Breaker/Specifications_Tab]` `[EZPDOC LV_Breaker/Phase_Trip_Tab]`

> **Cross-vendor confirmation `[ETAPDOC]` (2026-05-31):** ETAP (a *different* power-system tool)
> independently models the same LV trip-device types — **Thermal Magnetic · Solid-state · Motor Circuit
> Protector · Electro-mechanical** = our TMT · SST/ETU · (a TMT sub-type) · EMT. **MCP** (Motor Circuit
> Protector — magnetic/instantaneous-only) is a peer type in ETAP but folded into TMT in EasyPower via
> `TMT_BreakerType` (0=Thermal Magnetic / 1=Motor Circuit Protector, §4). Crucially, **ETAP confirms the
> breaker→compatible-trip narrowing** (the SST-bridge premise, §3): with a breaker selected, *"the Trip
> Device Library … will be limited to trip devices assigned to the selected circuit breaker size"*; with
> none selected, *all* are available. A second vendor's independent model of the bridge → strong evidence
> the narrowing is the **industry-standard** model, not an EasyPower quirk (it validates the SST-bridge fix
> direction). `[ETAPDOC LVCB_Setting]` See `_discovery/_validation/v5-etap-cross-vendor.md`.

## 2. The Breaker × Family interaction matrix  ← the core of this guide

| Family | Does breaker selection determine the trip? | Discriminator (on the breaker style row) | Mechanism (how the trip is reached from a breaker) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SST / ETU** | **Yes — the breaker style *points* to its compatible trip** | `TMT_Use_SST = 1` | `BreakerXXXStyles.(TMT_SST_Mfr, TMT_SST_Type, TMT_SST_Style)` → name-join → `DatStyle (Mfr_Name, TYPE, STYLE)` → `DatStyle.STYLE_ID` → `DatSensor.StyleID` → sections/plugs |
| **TMT** | **Yes — the breaker style *is* the trip** | `TMT_Use_SST = 0` | `BreakerXXXStyles.ID` → `Breaker_TMTFrameSizes.StyleID` → frame amps/settings (the thermal-mag curve is intrinsic to the frame) |
| **EMT** (= EasyPower **"Non-Solid State Trip"**) | **No *stored* default — but YES as a runtime user choice.** No breaker-style row carries a persisted breaker→EMT link (`TMT_SST_*` resolves **0** to the EMT catalog across ICCB/MCCB/PCB), so a catalog-driven selector can't *narrow* to a breaker's EMT trip; EMT stays manufacturer-scoped. But the vendor UI **does** let a user attach a Non-Solid-State (EMT) trip to a breaker. `[EZPDOC LV_Breaker/Specifications_Tab]` `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]` | breaker **Trip** field (LVPCB → {SS, NSS}; ICCB/MCCB → {SS, NSS, TM}), then trip-unit **Mfr/Type/Style** from the EMT catalog (no Sensor/Plug — SS-only) | a **runtime** selection from the `EMT*` catalog — **not** a library-stored default like the solid-state `TMT_SST_*` bridge. `TMT_Use_SST` is binary (1=has SS default / 0=thermal-mag) and does **not** encode the non-solid-state case. |

**Plain-language summary for the field/UI:**
- **ETU breaker** → the breaker tells you exactly which electronic trip belongs to it (one trip family, a handful of sensors). *This is what makes "T8V-1600 → ABB PR332/P → 5 sensors" possible — and what was lost when the bridge columns were dropped (see §3).*
- **TMT breaker** → there is no separate trip to pick; the breaker frame **is** the trip.
- **EMT breaker** → the breaker **library** stores no breaker→EMT default (the `TMT_SST_*` bridge resolves 0 to EMT), so a data-driven selector offers EMT **manufacturer-scoped**. But EasyPower's UI **does** let a user attach a Non-Solid-State (= EMT) trip to a breaker at runtime (Trip field + EMT-catalog Mfr/Type/Style). `[EZPDOC]` `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]`

---

## 3. SST / ETU — the bridge (detailed)

**Gate:** `BreakerXXXStyles.TMT_Use_SST = 1` means "this breaker shell borrows an electronic (SST/ETU)
trip"; `= 0` means thermal-magnetic (→ TMT). The flag itself carries **no DB description**; its
polarity is established from the engine. `[DVL-DB BreakerMCCBStyles.TMT_Use_SST → no description]`
`[DLL DevLibBreakerStyle.cs GetBreakerStyles → DefaultUseSST]`

**The composite-key join** (name-based, *not* a numeric FK — this is why a loader expecting
`Manufacturers.ID` silently dropped it): `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]` `[01]` `[04]`

```
BreakerXXXStyles.TMT_SST_Mfr   = Manufacturers.Mfr_Name        (→ Manufacturers.ID)
BreakerXXXStyles.TMT_SST_Type  = DatStyle.TYPE
BreakerXXXStyles.TMT_SST_Style = DatStyle.STYLE      (with DatStyle.MFG_ID = Manufacturers.ID)
        → DatStyle.STYLE_ID = DatSensor.StyleID  (declared FK)
        → DatSection1/2/3/4* . SensorID  and  DatPlugs.SensorID
```

**Where the stitch lives:** application code, not SQL. `DevLibBreakerStyle.GetBreakerStyles(...)`
binds `TMT_Use_SST`/`TMT_SST_*` → `DefaultUseSST`/`DefaultTrip{Manufacturer,Type,Style}`; surfaced by
`DeviceLibrary.GetDefaultTripInfo(...)`; those strings are re-fed as the trip-cascade seed.
`[DLL DevLibBreakerStyle.cs:135-139]` `[DLL DeviceLibrary.cs:478]` `[03]` `[HANDOFF 2026-04-29-tcc-breaker-trip-unit-filter-workflow-audit]`

**Population & join health (live, authoritative):** `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]` `[04]`

| Class | Styles | `Use_SST=1` | matched to `DatStyle` | match rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ICCB | 608 | 515 | 515 | **100%** |
| MCCB | 10,335 | 1,680 | 1,576 | **95.6%** |
| PCB | 3,279 | 3,193 | 2,162 | **97.5%** |

Unmatched rows are **genuine source catalog gaps** (missing `DatStyle` TYPE/STYLE combos), *not*
name-hygiene — `UCASE+TRIM` rescues 0. Fall back to manufacturer-scope + flag when no exact match.

**Worked example (the UI case):** breaker `T8V-1600` = `BreakerICCBStyles` id 44551, `TMT_Use_SST=1`,
SST = **ABB / PR332/P / ICCB-LSIG** → exactly **1 `DatStyle`** (STYLE_ID 1230) → **5 `DatSensor`** + 18
plugs. (Contrast the manufacturer-only UI, which offered 117 ABB trips.) `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]` `[04]`

> **Status of the persisted catalog — RECOVERED 2026-06-01 (D1, migration `006`):** the 4 bridge columns
> (`tmt_use_sst`, `tmt_sst_mfr/type/style`) are now **carried** on all 3 `tcc.brk_*_styles` tables
> (source-faithful NAME strings, re-carried from Access via the proven `rank=id` mapping). The stitch is
> realized by the BG-4 view **`tcc.vw_breaker_sst_bridge`** (breaker style → compatible sensor set), and the

> MCCB 95.6 / PCB 97.5% (non-null triples; residual = catalog gaps). Worked example holds live:
> `T8V-1600` (ICCB) → ABB/PR332/P/ICCB-LSIG → 5 sensors. **The cross-filter UX now consumes this surface

> `bridge_only`) and a bridge-aware **bidirectional** cross-filter (`bridge_xfilter`), now surfaced as a
> **co-equal dual-axis selector** (`99d0dc88`) — Breaker lane + Trip-Unit lane each narrow the other through
> the bridge, the sensor reachable from either end (live-verified both directions); the legacy *explorer*
> keeps manufacturer-axis only (opt-in). See G1 register D1 + the per-class `(class,id)` hazard (§2B), G2
> §4.3/BG-5, G3 §A3c, and handoff `2026-06-01-lvbreakertcc-live-wiring-closeout`. `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-06-01]`

**Same pattern, other domains** (for awareness; mapped in G1): `RelayDevices.SST_*` and
`DsgnProtEqp.SST*` use the identical "borrow-an-SST" shape (the latter via numeric `MFG_ID`). `[01]`

---

## 4. TMT — the trip *is* the frame (detailed)

**Gate:** `TMT_Use_SST = 0`. The thermal-magnetic curve is intrinsic to the breaker style's frame;
there is no separate trip-unit selection. `[DLL DevLibTMTFrameSize.cs]` `[03]`

**Path:** `BreakerXXXStyles.ID → Breaker_TMTFrameSizes.StyleID` → `Breaker_TMTFrameAmps` /
`Breaker_TMTFrameSettings`. `[DLL DeviceLibrary.cs:1322 ReadTmgnFrameIdsMatchingFrameAndTrip]`
`[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31 declared FK]` `[04]`

**TMT sub-discriminators on the breaker style** (decode before interpreting a TMT breaker): `[DVL-DB]` `[08]`

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TMT_BreakerType` | `0 = Thermal Magnetic`, `1 = Motor Circuit Protector` |
| `TMT_ThermalMagnetic` | `0 = With Adjustable Instantaneous`, `1 = Without adj instantaneous` |
| `TMT_TripPlug` | `0 = Trip`, `1 = Plug` |
| `c_testing_std` | `0 = ANSI-SYM`, `1 = IEC`, `2 = ANSI-TOTAL` (drives the test plan) |

**Instantaneous override on the frame:** the `InstOvr*` / `NInstOvr*` column blocks on the breaker
style carry a frame-limited instantaneous override (amps, tolerances, open/clear delay + radius).
These are **undescribed** in the DB and map to the engine's breaker-override mechanism. `[DEFERRED]`
`[DVL-DB BreakerMCCBStyles.InstOvr* → no description]` `[06]`

---

## 5. EMT — own catalog (detailed, with the open edge)

EMT is modeled by its own tables (`EMT`, `EMT_Frames`, `EMT_Sections`, `EMT_BandNames`, `EMT_Curves`)
and browsed via EMT facets — **never via `BreakerXXXStyles`.** `[01]` `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]`

**EMT discriminators** `[DVL-DB]` `[08]`:
- `EMT.TripChar` — **bitmap** `1=LT, 2=ST, 4=Inst` (OR-combined: `3`=LT+ST, `7`=all). **Decode bitwise, not as an ordinal.**
- `EMT.TripPlug` — `0 = Trip`, `1 = Plug`.
- `EMT PickupCalc = 0 → Ipu × TripAmps`; `EMT_Sections` carry conditional gates ("Delay/Radius used if `SecChar=4`").

**The open edge — REFINED 2026-05-31 (vendor doc + data probe): no STORED breaker→EMT default, but EMT
*is* a runtime-selectable breaker trip type.** This **corrects** the earlier "standalone-only" framing —
which was right about the *data* but overstated in *words*. Two facts, both verified: `[EZPDOC]` `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]`

**(a) There is NO persisted breaker→EMT link in the data** — so our catalog-driven selection cannot
*narrow* a breaker to its EMT trip; EMT stays manufacturer-scoped. Triangulated (`[DLL]` `[04]`
`[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]` — `_discovery/_validation/v3-emt-edge.md`):
- the managed `DeviceLibrary` (100% of device-SQL) has **zero** EMT references; the breaker-style reader
  `GetDefaultTripInfo` returns only `useSST` + the SST triple. `[DLL DevLibBreakerStyle.cs:135-159]`
- no `EMT_*` pointer column on any `BreakerICCB/MCCB/PCBStyles`; `EMT` has no breaker back-reference; and
  the **`TMT_SST_*` bridge resolves 0 to the EMT catalog** across all three classes (vs 515 / 1,576 / 2,162
  → DatStyle) — the bridge is purely a *solid-state* (DatStyle) bridge. `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]`

**(b) BUT EasyPower's UI lets a user attach a Non-Solid-State (= EMT) trip to a breaker at runtime.**
`[EZPDOC LV_Breaker/Specifications_Tab]` The breaker **Trip** field offers, by class: **LVPCB → {Solid
State, Non-Solid State}**; **ICCB/MCCB → {Solid State, Non-Solid State, Thermal Magnetic}**. "Non-Solid
State" **= EMT** (confirmed: the sample style `THMM-LSI` lives in `EMT`, not `DatStyle`). Both Solid-State
and Non-Solid-State are picked through the trip-unit **Mfr/Type/Style** section (Sensor/Plug are
**solid-state-only**). So the breaker↔EMT pairing is a **runtime user selection from the `EMT*` catalog**,
not a library-stored default like the solid-state `TMT_SST_*` bridge.

**Consequence for our platform:** `TMT_Use_SST` is binary (1 = has a solid-state default trip → DatStyle;
0 = thermal-magnetic frame) and does **not** encode the non-solid-state case — EasyPower simply doesn't
persist a default breaker→EMT mapping. So a data-driven selector offers EMT trips **manufacturer-scoped**
(matching the explorer-realign "EMT = construction-agnostic / manufacturer-only"), with the breaker→EMT
pairing left to the user. **Open refinement `[OPEN-VALIDATION]`:** how "non-solid-state breakers" (e.g. the
975 `Use_SST=1` PCB rows with a blank `TMT_SST_Style`) are represented in the library is not yet fully
characterized.

**Residual caveat (does not weaken the verdict):** the native EMT C++ reader internals are unreadable
(decompiled to size-only struct shells) — but the breaker→trip dispatch lives entirely in the readable
managed layer, and that layer offers EMT no entry point.

**EMT load + curve chain (corrected 2026-05-31):** EMT **IS** loaded into `tcc.*` (7 populated tables:
`emt` 174, `emt_frames` 805, `emt_frame_amps` 1691, `emt_sections` 1765, `emt_band_names` 2971,
`emt_pickups` 6587, `emt_curves` 40735 — small RI-orphan deltas vs Access). The earlier "not yet
loaded" reading was stale; only browsable-UI *exposure* is a separate open question. The curve chain is
`EMT_Curves → EMT_BandNames(SecID) → EMT_Sections → EMT_Frames → EMT` (G1 §2D — `EMT_Curves.ParentID →
EMT_BandNames.ID`, 100%). `[VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-05-31]`

## 6. How families route into pickup/delay calc (pointer to G3/G4)

Once a family + sensor is selected, the **per-element routing** is governed by the engine constants
(authoritative table in G3/G4; named here so the family→calc handoff is explicit):
- Pickup method per element: `DS1/DS3/DS4/DS1GF_PICKUP_CALC` → `SSTCalcMethod` (`DVL_SST_SETTING_*`, -1..10). `[DLL SSTCalcMethod.cs:3-17]` `[09]`
- Delay routing per element: `DS3_SEC3_I2T`/`DS1GF_SEC3_I2T` → `SSTDelayCalc` (`DB_SST_DLCALC_*`, **0..4** — *not* the DB-described "0 or 1"). `[DLL DeviceLibrary.cs:67-75]` `[09]`
