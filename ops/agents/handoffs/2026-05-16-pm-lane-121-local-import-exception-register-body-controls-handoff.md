# PM Lane 121 - Local Import Exception Decision Register Body Controls Handoff

## Purpose

PM Lane 121 reduces the `/pm-review/import-intake` scan burden by wrapping only the existing `Local import exception decision register` body content in a labeled body-controls container under its already-existing browser-native, default-open disclosure.

This is local import-exception-register scanning and AI-orchestration ergonomics only. It does not accept, approve, persist, deploy, import, assign, schedule, change status, create issues, create tasks, create durable field records, write production tracking rows, claim hosted parity, or mutate production state.

## Source Floor

- Repo: `C:/APEX Platform/apex-power-ops-platform`
- Branch: `clean-main`
- Source floor: `11a026a64fb93bf614cb9daf0c3330dd2d82c11f`
- Prior lane: PM Lane 120, Local PM Operating Queue Body Controls
- Parallel external lane available: Desktop Codex hosted parity dispatch through PM Lane 076

## Implemented Scope

- Added only a labeled `Import exception register controls` body container under the existing `Local import exception decision register` disclosure summary.
- Preserved the `#import-exception-register` anchor, existing disclosure, aria label, heading, browser-local pill, and placement inside `Source and Exception Detail`.
- Preserved the explanatory no-authority wording, covered/open/blocked summary count, six derived register cards, card order, dynamic detail/evidence text, status pills, quick-jump target, read seams, export behavior, and no-storage behavior.
- Added focused smoke coverage for default-open state, visible body controls, collapse/reopen behavior, hidden/visible exception-register controls, six register articles, no `collapse|disclosure|import-exception-register` localStorage key, and unchanged register labels.
- Updated the PM lane workflow docs, Temp Power orchestration plan, stakeholder acceleration lane, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and this packet/handoff.

```

## Validation Results

- `corepack pnpm --filter @apex/operations-web typecheck` passed.
- `corepack pnpm --filter @apex/operations-web build` passed and included `/pm-review/import-intake` in the static route output.
- Authority wording scan returned no matches for affirmative execution/admission/field-readiness/production-ready wording.
- `corepack pnpm --dir apps/operations-web exec playwright test tests/browser-shell.pm-import-intake.smoke.spec.ts` passed with 1 test.
- `corepack pnpm --dir apps/operations-web exec playwright test tests/browser-shell.pm-import-candidate.smoke.spec.ts tests/browser-shell.pm-import-admission-plan.smoke.spec.ts tests/browser-shell.pm-import-approval-readiness.smoke.spec.ts tests/browser-shell.pm-import-intake.smoke.spec.ts` passed with 4 tests.
- Packet JSON parse returned `packet-json-ok`.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.

## Next Recommended Lane

`PM Lane 122 - Local Workflow Gates Body Controls`

That next lane should wrap only the existing `Workflow gates` body content under its already-existing default-open disclosure, preserving the workflow-gates anchor, gate copy, gate cards, status pills, export and read behavior if present, no persisted collapse state, no authority widening, and the same focused smoke pattern.
