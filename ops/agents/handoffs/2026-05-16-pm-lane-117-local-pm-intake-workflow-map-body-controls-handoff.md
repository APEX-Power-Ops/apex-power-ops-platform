# PM Lane 117 - Local PM Intake Workflow Map Body Controls Handoff

## Purpose

PM Lane 117 reduces the `/pm-review/import-intake` scan burden by wrapping only the existing `Local PM intake workflow map` body content in a labeled body-controls container under its already-existing browser-native, default-open disclosure.

This is local PM workflow-orientation and AI-orchestration ergonomics only. It does not accept, approve, persist, deploy, import, assign, schedule, change status, create issues, create tasks, create durable field records, write production tracking rows, claim hosted parity, or mutate production state.

## Source Floor

- Repo: `C:/APEX Platform/apex-power-ops-platform`
- Branch: `clean-main`
- Source floor: `2f3db605e58178230267303eb1d8aaa109188857`
- Prior lane: PM Lane 116, Local PM Intake Handoff Guide Body Controls

## Implemented Scope

- Added only a labeled `Workflow map controls` body container under the existing `Local PM intake workflow map` disclosure summary.
- Preserved the `#pm-workflow-map` anchor, existing disclosure, aria label, heading, browser-local pill, and placement inside `Workflow Review Panels` after `#pm-handoff-guide`.
- Preserved the explanatory no-authority wording, seven derived workflow-map cards, card order, hrefs, dynamic text, status pills, quick-jump target, read seams, and no-storage behavior.
- Added focused smoke coverage for default-open state, visible body controls, collapse/reopen behavior, hidden/visible workflow-map controls, seven workflow-map links, no `collapse|disclosure|workflow-map` localStorage key, unchanged hrefs, and unchanged before/after dynamic workflow-map assertions.
- Updated the PM lane workflow docs, Temp Power orchestration plan, stakeholder acceleration lane, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and this packet/handoff.

## Not Allowed

- No backend endpoint change.
- No new route or route target change.
- No quick-jump, route-link, output action, output status, project packet, source freshness, import exception register, workflow gates, exception review detail, admission and approval contract, local review checklist, local approval decision draft, local executor closeout intake, local field readiness checklist, local field questions draft, field prep queue, field prep coverage snapshot, field prep conversation agenda, field observation scratchpad, approval-readiness, guardrails, command-center, meeting-readout, constraint radar, daily-review-script, start-here, output-selector, handoff-guide, snapshot, operating queue, or open-items behavior change.

## Sidecar Result

A read-only PM Lane 118 sidecar scout ran in parallel and made no edits, staged nothing, committed nothing, ran no macros, created no artifacts, and did not touch Supabase, Render, Vercel, Olares, live services, source-domain files, project source files, or workbook files.

Recommended next lane:

`Project Miner Local PM Intake Open Items Lens Body Controls`

The recommended PM Lane 118 scope is to add only a body wrapper under the existing `Local PM Intake Open Items Lens` disclosure summary, preserving the `#pm-open-items` anchor, aria label, heading, browser-local pill, existing copy, six open-items cards, hrefs, order, dynamic text, status pills, no persisted collapse state, and read seams.

## Validation Commands

Run from `C:/APEX Platform/apex-power-ops-platform`:

git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

## Validation Results

- `corepack pnpm --filter @apex/operations-web typecheck` passed.
- `corepack pnpm --filter @apex/operations-web build` passed and included `/pm-review/import-intake` in the static route output.
- Authority wording scan returned no matches for affirmative execution/admission/field-readiness/production-ready wording.
- `corepack pnpm --dir apps/operations-web exec playwright test tests/browser-shell.pm-import-intake.smoke.spec.ts` passed with 1 test.
- `corepack pnpm --dir apps/operations-web exec playwright test tests/browser-shell.pm-import-candidate.smoke.spec.ts tests/browser-shell.pm-import-admission-plan.smoke.spec.ts tests/browser-shell.pm-import-approval-readiness.smoke.spec.ts tests/browser-shell.pm-import-intake.smoke.spec.ts` passed with 4 tests.
- Packet JSON parse returned `packet-json-ok`.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- `git diff --cached --check` passed after staging only the Lane 117 files.

## Closeout Requirements

- Stage only the Lane 117 files listed above.
- Commit with message `Add PM workflow map body controls`.
- Push `clean-main`.
- Restore Olares host parity with `git pull --ff-only`.
- Verify local and host heads match and `bash tools/ai/run-minimal-mcp-trio.sh status` returns `{"status":"not-running"}`.
